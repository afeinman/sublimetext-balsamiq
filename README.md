sublimetext-balsamiq
====================

Sublime Text 3 syntax language for Balsamiq markup. (The text-based stuff in the interface that looks a bit like Markdown, not the XML underneath.)

I often find myself editing Grids and other large text-based bits of Balsamiq markup in SublimeText, and then painstakingly trying to find the missing underscore or extra tab. This helps with that.

Enjoy!
